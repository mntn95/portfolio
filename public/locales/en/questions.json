        "cost": {
            "question": "How much does a website cost?",
            "answer": "Since every project is unique, the price varies depending on your needs: custom design, specific features, technical complexity... The more information you provide about your project, the more accurate and transparent a quote I can give you. Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss it!"
        },
        "how_long": {
            "question": "How long does it take to create a website?",
            "answer": "A landing page can be delivered in 3 days, while a showcase website takes one week. More complex projects with API integration require several weeks, depending on scope and collaboration efficiency."
        },
        "communication": {
            "question": "How does communication work during the project?",
            "answer": "Everything starts with a discovery call to understand your needs. Then, we'll communicate mainly by email or messages to keep a clear record of our exchanges. I'll send you regular progress updates and you'll be able to follow the development at every step."
        },
        "dont_like": {
            "question": "What if I don't like the website?",
            "answer": "No worries. Before starting development, I'll present you with a mockup or preview of the final result. You'll be able to give me your feedback at this stage and we'll adjust until we achieve a result that meets your expectations. Nothing is launched without your approval."
        },
        "payments": {
            "question": "How do payments work?",
            "answer": "It depends on the type of project. For website creation, I'll ask for a 50% deposit before starting development. The rest will be paid upon project delivery. For freelance assignments, I offer daily rate or deliverable-based pricing, but we can discuss this together. For maintenance, I offer monthly or annual payment."
        },
        "only_online": {
            "question": "Can I pay only when the site is online?",
            "answer": "No, because most of the work is done well before the site goes live. I invoice according to the schedule agreed upon at the start. This ensures a regular pace and good organization on both sides."
        },
        "hosting": {
            "question": "Who handles hosting?",
            "answer": "You have two options: You manage your own hosting (I'll help you configure it), or I take care of it as part of a monthly maintenance package. I use the same hosting provider for all my clients (unless specifically requested), which makes management simpler and ensures optimal security."
        },
        "source_code": {
            "question": "Can I access the source code once the project is completed?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. The code belongs to you once the project is delivered. You'll be able to access it freely to modify it, develop it further, or pass it on to another developer. If you opt for a maintenance package, I remain the technical manager as long as the support is active, to ensure project consistency."
        }
    }
