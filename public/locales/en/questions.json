            "question": "What types of services do you offer?",
            "answer": "I offer three types of services: custom website creation (landing pages, showcase websites, etc.), maintenance of existing websites, and long-term freelance integration within tech teams as a front-end developer. Depending on your needs, I can work on a one-time project or join your team for several months."
        },
        "freelance_mission": {
            "question": "How does a freelance assignment within a team work?",
            "answer": "I integrate into your existing team to strengthen your front-end development capabilities. I adapt to your processes, tools (Git, Jira, Slack...) and methodologies (Agile, Scrum...). I participate in daily meetings, code reviews, and sprints as a full-fledged team member. The goal is to deliver value quickly while respecting your quality standards."
        },
        "tjm": {
            "question": "What is your daily rate?",
            "answer": "My daily rate varies depending on the assignment duration, complexity, and technologies used. For long-term assignments (3 months or more), I offer preferential rates. Contact me to discuss your project and get a personalized quote."
        },
        "availability": {
            "question": "What is your availability?",
            "answer": "For long-term assignments, I'm available immediately. For website creation, my availability depends on my current projects: if I have one ongoing, you'll be next on my list. Feel free to contact me to confirm my current availability."
        },
        "tech_stack": {
            "question": "What technologies do you work with?",
            "answer": "I specialize in the modern JavaScript ecosystem: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. I also have experience with GraphQL, Redux, Jest, Cypress, and other front-end tools. I adapt quickly to new frameworks when the project requires it."
        },
        "remote_onsite": {
            "question": "Do you work remotely or on-site?",
            "answer": "For website creation, I work exclusively remotely. For long-term assignments, I'm flexible: I can work entirely remotely or travel to the Paris region depending on your preferences and project needs."
        },
        "cost": {
            "question": "How much does a website cost?",
            "answer": "Since every project is unique, the price varies depending on your needs: custom design, specific features, technical complexity... The more information you provide about your project, the more accurate and transparent a quote I can give you. Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss it!"
        },
        "how_long": {
            "question": "How long does it take to create a website?",
            "answer": "A landing page can be delivered in 3 days, while a showcase website generally takes one week. More complex projects with API integration require several weeks, depending on scope and collaboration efficiency."
        },
        "communication": {
            "question": "How does communication work during the project?",
            "answer": "Everything starts with a discovery call to understand your needs. Then, we'll communicate mainly by email or messages to keep a clear record of our exchanges. I'll send you regular progress updates and you'll be able to follow the development at every step."
        },
        "payments": {
            "question": "How do payments work?",
            "answer": "It depends on the type of project. For website creation, I ask for a 50% deposit before starting development, with the remainder paid upon delivery. For long-term freelance assignments, I invoice at a daily rate with a frequency we agree upon together. For maintenance, I offer monthly or annual payment."
        },
        "dont_like": {
            "question": "What if I don't like the website?",
            "answer": "No worries. Before starting development, I'll present you with a mockup or preview of the final result. You'll be able to give me your feedback at this stage and we'll adjust until we achieve a result that meets your expectations. Nothing is launched without your approval."
        },
        "hosting": {
            "question": "Who handles hosting?",
            "answer": "You have two options: you manage your own hosting (I'll help you configure it), or I take care of it as part of a monthly maintenance package. I use the same hosting provider for all my clients (unless specifically requested), which makes management simpler and ensures optimal security."
        },
        "source_code": {
            "question": "Can I access the source code once the project is completed?",
            "answer": "Absolutely. The code belongs to you once the project is delivered. You'll be able to access it freely to modify it, develop it further, or pass it on to another developer. If you opt for a maintenance package, I remain the technical manager as long as the support is active, to ensure project consistency."
        },
        "contact": {
            "question": "How can I contact you?",
            "answer": "You can contact me by email at mathieu.nguyen@proton.me or from my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-ng/). I usually respond within a couple of hours."
