He's someone who's highly involved, serious about his work, always open to feedback, and with a real desire to improve. He always took feedback constructively, and it showed in the quality of his work. Besides being a good developer, he's also a really nice person, always willing to lend a hand and bring good vibes to the team. In short, a real pleasure to work with. I recommend him without hesitation!"
